# HTTP API

The `/v1` job API is the decoupled surface for a front end. It is async:
submit text, get a job handle, poll or stream until the report is ready. For an
in-process integration prefer [`StrideEngine`](Integration-Guide.md) — it drives
the same pipeline without the job/auth/polling machinery.

Build the app with `create_app()`; every seam is injectable, defaulting to
production wiring.

```python
from stride_service import create_app

app = create_app()   # configured store, real pipeline, configured JWT verifier
```

See [Configuration](Configuration.md) for the required
[`STRIDE_AUTH_PROVIDER` / `STRIDE_OIDC_*`](Configuration.md#bearer-auth-http-surface-only),
the [`STRIDE_JOB_STORE`](Configuration.md#job-storage-http-surface-only) backend
selection, and the
[credentials](Configuration.md#provider-environment) for whichever model vendor
each tier uses.

## Auth

Every `/v1` route requires a bearer JWT (RS256, verified against the configured
issuer, audience, and JWKS) from the selected auth provider — see
[Configuration](Configuration.md#bearer-auth-http-surface-only) for supported
identity providers and setup. Job reads are **owner-only**: a request from
anyone but the job's owner gets `404`, not `403`, so job IDs cannot be probed
for existence. Rejection detail is generic on purpose — the real reason is
logged, never returned.

## Routes

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/v1/jobs` | Submit a description; returns a job handle. |
| `GET` | `/v1/jobs/{id}` | Poll: status, per-node progress, timestamps. Never the report. |
| `GET` | `/v1/jobs/{id}/events` | The same progression as Server-Sent Events; resumable via `Last-Event-ID`. |
| `GET` | `/v1/jobs/{id}/report` | The full [report](Report-Schema.md) once completed; `409` before, and `409` if the report is withheld (below). |
| `GET` | `/healthz` | Unauthenticated liveness probe. |

Errors are RFC 9457 `application/problem+json`.

### When the report is withheld

A completed job's report can still be refused. Before serving it, the service
checks the run's **fingerprints** — a per-node hash of the model build that
answered plus that tier's decoding parameters — against the list this deployment
has **blessed** (approved by a measured run, in
`config/blessed-fingerprints.toml`). Two cases refuse with `409`:

- the run is **uncertified** (a fingerprint isn't blessed) *and*
  `STRIDE_REQUIRE_CERTIFIED` is set — off by default;
- the run is **unexercised** (a tier the graph declares produced no fingerprint
  at all) — always refused, and not reachable on a run that produced a report.

The problem body names the unblessed nodes and their hashes, and the tiers that
went unexercised. It never includes the analysis. The job itself stays
`completed` — withholding refuses the delivery, not the work, because the
fingerprints that show what drifted live inside the report. Nothing about this
appears in `GET /v1/jobs/{id}`; it is operator-facing only. See
[Configuration](Configuration.md#provenance-and-certification).

## Lifecycle

```
queued -> running -> completed | failed | rejected
```

- `completed` — the report is available at `/v1/jobs/{id}/report`.
- `rejected` — the input failed the validity gate; the poll response carries the
  `validation_issues` (see [Report-Schema](Report-Schema.md)).
- `failed` — an internal error; only a generic message is exposed.

This mirrors the engine's three outcomes; the HTTP layer adds the queue,
ownership, and delivery around them.

## Submit and poll

```http
POST /v1/jobs
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
Content-Type: application/json

{"description": "Customers sign in and place orders...", "system_name": "Orders"}
```

```json
201 Created
Location: /v1/jobs/job-ab12...
{"job_id": "job-ab12...", "status": "queued"}
```

Then `GET /v1/jobs/job-ab12...` until `status` is terminal, or subscribe to
`GET /v1/jobs/job-ab12.../events`. The description is capped at 100 KiB (see
[Configuration](Configuration.md)); an oversized body is rejected before parsing.
